BMA150 Linux device driver
--------------------------

This driver implements support for Bosch Sensortec's BMA150 accelerometer sensors. This driver is also fully compatible
with the SMB380 and BMA023 versions of the chip.
The driver is interfaced through the input layer and sends ABS_X, ABS_Y and ABS_Z events. It supports a polled setup
and an interrupt driven setup.
